# AK Dream Vista - React Frontend (Clone)

This is a small React + Vite project that recreates the main layout of **akdreamvista.com**:
- Header with navigation and phone number
- Hero banner with "Discover your Dream House"
- Search section (status, type, bedrooms, etc.)
- Property list grid with two sample properties
- Footer with contact details and social links

All external images are loaded directly from the original site URLs.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have **Node.js 18+** installed.
2. Extract the ZIP.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Open the development URL shown in the terminal (usually http://23.20.0.192:5173).

You can now edit the React components in `src/components` and customize the layout, data,
and styling as you like.
